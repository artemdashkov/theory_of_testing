## Prioritize features to test based on the following factors:
- Recent—New features, new areas of code, new functionality that has been recently repaired, refactored, or otherwise modified
- Core—Your product’s unique selling propositions (USPs). The essential functions that must continue to work in order for the product to be useful
- Risk—Areas of the application that pose more risk, such as areas important to customers but not used regularly by the development team or parts that use third-party code you don’t quite trust
- Problematic—Functionality that frequently breaks or often gets defect reports against it
- Expertise—Features or algorithms understood by a limited subset of people report
